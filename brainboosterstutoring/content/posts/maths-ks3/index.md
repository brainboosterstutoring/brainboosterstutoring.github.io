## What’s covered (at a glance)

KS3 maths is organised into these domains: **Number**, **Algebra**, **Ratio & Proportion**, **Geometry & Measures**, **Probability**, and **Statistics**. Typical content includes: negative numbers and indices; fractions/decimals/percentages; equations and inequalities; sequences; graphs (including straight-line graphs); ratio, scale and percentage change; area, volume and similarity; **Pythagoras’ theorem** and right-triangle **trigonometry**; averages, representations and experimental probability. ([GOV.UK][1])

## Common sticky spots

- **Algebraic manipulation**: rearranging, expanding/factorising, and solving multi-step equations/inequalities. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Fractions ↔ decimals ↔ percentages** in multi-step contexts (ratio, growth/decay, reverse problems). ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Graphs & functions**: linking tables, equations and coordinates; interpreting gradients/intercepts. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Geometry with reasoning**: angle proofs, similarity, and moving from measuring to proving. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Right-triangle methods**: choosing between Pythagoras and trig, and setting up diagrams correctly. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Data & probability language**: selecting the right representation and justifying conclusions. ([GOV.UK][3])

## How I support your child

- **Bridging plan from KS2 → KS3**: quick diagnostic to spot gaps; targeted fluency on the essentials. ([GOV.UK][3])  
- **Concrete → pictorial → abstract** (e.g., algebra tiles for expansion/factorising) to make new ideas stick. ([GOV.UK][3])  
- **Explicit teaching + worked examples**, then **guided practice** and short retrieval to keep knowledge fresh. ([GOV.UK][3])  
- **Reasoning talk**: sentence stems and structured explanations so pupils can show the “why,” not just the “how.” ([GOV.UK][3])  
- **Calm confidence culture**: mistakes are information; small wins each lesson; clear next steps shared with parents.
