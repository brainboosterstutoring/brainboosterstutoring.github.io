## What’s covered (at a glance)

**Biology** – cells and microscopy; body systems (skeleton, muscles, gas exchange, digestion); photosynthesis and respiration; ecosystems, interdependence, and biodiversity; inheritance, DNA and variation. ([GOV.UK][1])

**Chemistry** – particle model and changes of state; atoms/elements/compounds and simple formulae; pure vs impure substances and separation; types of reactions (combustion, oxidation, acids/alkalis); energetics (exo/endothermic); the Periodic Table; materials and Earth/atmosphere (rock cycle, resources, carbon cycle). ([GOV.UK][1])

**Physics** – energy stores and transfers; motion and forces; pressure in fluids; waves (sound and light); electricity and magnetism; using equations and quantitative relationships. ([GOV.UK][1])

**Working scientifically** – planning enquiries (independent/dependent/control variables), safe practical work, taking measurements, analysing data with tables/graphs, evaluating methods, and using **SI units** and scientific vocabulary precisely. ([GOV.UK][1])

## Common sticky spots

- **Experimental design:** choosing a suitable enquiry and controlling variables for a fair test. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Graphs & data:** selecting the right representation, reading scales, and justifying conclusions from evidence. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Units & formulas:** converting between **SI units**, rearranging equations, and linking maths to measurements. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Particles & conservation:** moving from the particle model to explaining diffusion, changes of state, and why mass is conserved in reactions. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Energy & electricity:** distinguishing energy stores vs transfers, interpreting circuits, and explaining cause–effect clearly. ([GOV.UK][1])

## How I support your child

- **Quick diagnostic → tailored plan:** I identify gaps from KS2 and early KS3, then set clear, achievable steps.  
- **Hands-on, safe practicals:** build understanding through simple investigations, not just notes—always tied to “working scientifically.” ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Concrete → pictorial → abstract:** diagrams, models and sentence stems before formal symbols and equations.  
- **Maths-in-science boosters:** targeted help with units, graphs and rearranging formulas so calculations feel routine. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Feedback parents can use:** brief updates after lessons, with small practice tasks to lock in progress.

If you’d like, I can run a short, no-pressure assessment and share a 4–6 week plan focused on confidence and strong habits in KS3 science.
