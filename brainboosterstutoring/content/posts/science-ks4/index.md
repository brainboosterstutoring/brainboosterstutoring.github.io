## What’s covered (at a glance)

At **Key Stage 4 (Years 10–11)**, science builds on KS3 with a balanced programme across **biology, chemistry and physics**, underpinned by **mathematical skills** and **working scientifically** (planning enquiries, collecting/analysing data, evaluating evidence). ([GOV.UK][1])

**Biology** – big ideas and typical topics include:  
- **Cell biology** (cells, enzymes, respiration, biological molecules)  
- **Transport systems** (circulatory and plant transport)  
- **Health, disease & medicines** (pathogens, immunity, prevention)  
- **Coordination & control** (nervous/hormonal systems, homeostasis)  
- **Photosynthesis** (process and factors)  
- **Ecosystems** (interdependence, biodiversity, cycling of materials, human impacts) ([GOV.UK][1])

**Chemistry** – structure, materials and Earth systems:  
- **Atomic structure & the Periodic Table**  
- **Structure, bonding & properties of matter** (ionic/covalent/metallic; intermolecular forces; carbon structures)  
- **Earth & atmospheric science** (composition, climate evidence/uncertainties, pollutants, water resources) ([GOV.UK][1])

**Physics** – models, quantities and real-world applications:  
- **Energy** (changes, stores, calculations)  
- **Electricity** (circuits, charge, mains safety; power transfer)  
- **Magnetism & electromagnetism** (fields, solenoids, transformers/National Grid)  
- **The structure of matter** (states, particle motion, specific heat/latent heat, gas pressure–temperature links)  
- **Atomic structure** (nuclear model, isotopes, ionising radiation, half-life, fission/fusion)  
- **Space physics** (solar system overview) ([GOV.UK][1])

> In KS4, **working scientifically** is taught **through** the subject content, with maths used in context (units, graphs, analysis). ([GOV.UK][1])

## Common sticky spots

- **Experimental design & variables** (fair tests, sampling, reliability vs validity)  
- **Multi-step calculations with units/standard form**; converting and rearranging **equations**  
- **Graphs & data** (choosing the right representation, interpreting gradients/intercepts, uncertainty)  
- **Linking models to observations** (particle model, energy stores vs transfers, circuit behaviour)  
- **Extended responses** (using precise scientific vocabulary to explain cause–effect)

## How I support your child

- **Diagnostic → tailored plan:** quick baseline to target priority gaps and map deadlines.  
- **Hands-on practicals, safely:** clear routines for planning, measuring, recording and evaluating—always tied to “working scientifically.” ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Maths-in-science boosters:** units, significant figures, ratios/percentages, and confident graph work.  
- **Model–explain–apply:** concise teaching with worked examples, then guided practice and retrieval to make learning stick.  
- **Exam-ready communication:** sentence stems and structures for clear, evidence-based answers.  
- **Parent updates:** short notes and purposeful home tasks to keep momentum between sessions.
