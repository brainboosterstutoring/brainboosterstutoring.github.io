## What’s covered (at a glance)

At **Key Stage 4 (Years 10–11)**, mathematics builds on KS3 and develops pupils’ ability to **be fluent**, **reason mathematically**, and **solve problems** across six strands: **Number, Algebra, Ratio & Proportion, Geometry & Measures, Probability,** and **Statistics**. These aims are taught **through the subject content** rather than as add-ons. ([GOV.UK][1])

Typical KS4 content includes:

- **Number** – fractions/decimals/percentages, ratio, **standard form**, **surds**, error bounds, growth/decay and compound measures. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Algebra** – manipulating expressions; **equations & inequalities** (including **simultaneous**); sequences; **graphs** (linear, quadratic and others); rearranging formulae. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Ratio & Proportion** – direct/inverse proportion, percentage change, best buys, speed–density–pressure. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Geometry & Measures** – **Pythagoras** and **trigonometry** (including sine/cosine rule), **circle theorems**, **vectors**, constructions & loci, transformations, perimeter/area/volume (including spheres, cones, frustums). ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Probability** – single and combined events, **tree diagrams**, **Venn diagrams**, expected outcomes. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Statistics** – sampling; representing and interpreting data (**histograms**, **cumulative frequency**, **box plots**, **scatter**); averages and spread; correlation vs causation. ([GOV.UK][1])

> In KS4, “**working mathematically**” (selecting methods, reasoning, and communicating clearly) is embedded throughout the domains. ([GOV.UK][1])

## Common sticky spots

- **Multi-step ratio/percentage problems** (reverse percentages, compound change, best-buy reasoning).  
- **Algebraic fluency** (rearranging, factorising, solving quadratics; linking equations ↔ graphs).  
- **Choosing the right triangle tool** (Pythagoras vs SOHCAHTOA vs sine/cosine rule) and setting up diagrams.  
- **Geometric reasoning & proof** (circle theorems, similarity/congruence, vector proofs).  
- **Data handling with accuracy** (selecting the correct representation; interpreting gradients, medians, IQR; understanding bias and sampling).  
- **Units, bounds & error** (significant figures, error intervals, standard form in calculations).  

## How I support your child

- **Diagnostic → tailored plan:** a quick baseline highlights priorities; we map a realistic 4–6 week route with checkpoints.  
- **Model–guide–independence:** concise teaching with **worked examples**, then guided practice and short **retrieval** to make methods automatic.  
- **Concrete → pictorial → abstract where helpful:** e.g., visual models for ratio, area reasoning for algebra, right-triangle sketches for trig.  
- **Reasoning talk:** sentence stems for justifications (“because… therefore… so…”) to strengthen exam-style explanations.  
- **Exam technique & timing:** mark-scheme habits, showing clear methods, and splitting time sensibly across calculator and non-calculator papers.  
- **Parent updates:** brief notes after sessions and targeted home tasks to keep momentum between lessons.
