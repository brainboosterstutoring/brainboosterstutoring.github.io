## What’s covered (at a glance)

**Key Stage 1 (Years 1–2)**
Counting and place value, number bonds, addition/subtraction, early multiplication/division, money, time, and simple shapes/measures.
(See the **Mathematics** section in the **[Primary National Curriculum (PDF)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a81a9abe5274a2e8ab55319/PRIMARY_national_curriculum.pdf)**.)

**Key Stage 2 (Years 3–6)**
Larger numbers and efficient methods, times tables, fractions/decimals/percentages, long multiplication/division, ratio, algebraic thinking, geometry, and measurement.
(Again, outlined in the **[Primary National Curriculum (PDF)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a81a9abe5274a2e8ab55319/PRIMARY_national_curriculum.pdf)**.)

## Common sticky spots for children

* **Number sense & place value** (e.g., regrouping across 10/100).
* **Times tables recall**, which underpins most KS2 methods.
* **Fractions → decimals → percentages**, especially equivalence.
* **Multi-step word problems**, where language can hide the maths.
* **Time and measures**, including converting between units.

## How I support your child

* **Personalised plan:** I meet them where they are and map clear next steps.
* **Concrete → pictorial → abstract:** hands-on models before symbols.
* **Small wins, often:** short practice, retrieval, and lots of encouragement.
* **Confidence culture:** mistakes are information, not failure.
* **Light-touch homework & parent updates** so you always know how it’s going.
