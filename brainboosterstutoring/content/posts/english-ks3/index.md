## What’s covered (at a glance)

**Reading**  
Wide, challenging reading of whole texts across fiction and non-fiction, including **pre-1914 and contemporary literature**, **Shakespeare (two plays across KS3)**, poetry, drama, and **seminal world literature**. Emphasis on critical reading: language, structure, conventions, and comparing texts. ([GOV.UK][1])

**Writing**  
Accurate, fluent writing **at length** for varied purposes and audiences: formal essays, narratives, scripts, poetry, arguments and letters; planning–drafting–editing; and secure **grammar, punctuation and spelling**. ([GOV.UK][1])

**Grammar & Vocabulary**  
Extending KS2 knowledge, using **Standard English**, formal/informal register, and precise linguistic terms to discuss reading and writing. ([GOV.UK][1])

**Spoken English**  
Short speeches and presentations, **formal debates**, structured discussion, and performance of plays/poetry. ([GOV.UK][1])

## Common sticky spots

- **Alighting on meaning in older texts** (Shakespeare, pre-1914 prose/poetry) and making **critical comparisons** across works. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Analytical essay writing**: building clear arguments, selecting evidence, and explaining effects of language/structure. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Grammar in context**: clauses, sentence variety, and accurate punctuation in longer pieces. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Academic vocabulary & register**: shifting between informal and formal Standard English with confidence. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Speaking for purpose**: debate conventions, summarising others’ points, and presenting succinctly. ([GOV.UK][1])

## How I support your child

- **Quick diagnostic → tailored plan:** I check reading/writing baselines and set focused goals for the next 4–6 weeks.  
- **Modelling the ‘how’:** worked examples, shared writing, and clear structures for paragraphs and essays; then guided practice and short retrieval to make it stick.  
- **Close reading routines:** annotation, vocabulary in context, and sentence-level analysis before moving to full essays—especially helpful with Shakespeare and older prose/poetry. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Grammar where it lives:** brief, targeted mini-lessons woven into real reading/writing, with immediate application and feedback. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Confident communication:** low-pressure practice for speeches/debates and supportive sentence stems so students can explain ideas clearly. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Parent updates:** concise notes after lessons and small, purposeful tasks to lock in progress.
