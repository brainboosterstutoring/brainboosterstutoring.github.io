## What’s covered (at a glance)

At **Key Stage 4 (Years 10–11)**, English builds on KS3 and prepares students for GCSE qualifications. Programmes typically cover:

**English Language**  
- **Reading** a range of 19th-, 20th- and 21st-century texts (fiction and non-fiction): analysing **language** and **structure**, synthesising ideas, comparing texts, and evaluating writers’ methods. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Writing** for different purposes and audiences: **creative/narrative** and **transactional** pieces (e.g., letters, speeches, articles) with clear organisation, accurate **grammar, punctuation and spelling (SPaG)**, and ambitious vocabulary. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Spoken language**: planning and delivering a presentation, responding to questions, and using Standard English appropriately. ([GOV.UK][1])

**English Literature**  
- Study of set texts typically including a **Shakespeare** play, a **19th-century novel**, a **modern prose/drama** text, and a **poetry anthology**, plus **unseen poetry** comparison—developing interpretation, critical analysis and comparison skills. ([GOV.UK][1])

> Source context: DfE **Secondary national curriculum (KS3–4) framework**, which sets aims and subject entitlement and informs KS4 English programmes. ([GOV.UK][1])

## Common sticky spots

- **Unseen texts & poetry**: inferring meaning quickly and structuring comparisons under time pressure.  
- **Analytical writing**: crafting a clear **thesis**, selecting precise **evidence**, and explaining **effects** without “feature-spotting.”  
- **Balancing content and accuracy**: sustaining argument while maintaining strong **SPaG** and coherent paragraphing.  
- **Context & terminology**: using them **selectively and relevantly** rather than as bolt-ons.  
- **Exam timing**: allocating minutes per question and sticking to a plan.

## How I support your child

- **Diagnostic → tailored plan:** quick baseline for reading/writing; targets aligned to assessment objectives and realistic timelines.  
- **Model–guide–independence:** I model **paragraph structures** (e.g., evidence → analysis → evaluation), then guide practice and build independence with retrieval and quick drills.  
- **Close-reading routines:** efficient annotation, zoom-in/zoom-out analysis, and comparison frameworks for unseen tasks.  
- **Writing workshops:** planning frames, purposeful openings, **varied sentence forms**, and vocabulary upgrades—always with live feedback.  
- **Spoken confidence:** low-pressure practice for presentations/debates with supportive **sentence stems**.  
- **Parent updates:** concise notes after sessions and optional home tasks to keep momentum between lessons.
