## What’s covered (at a glance)

**Key Stage 1 (Years 1–2):** Spoken language, **phonics & early reading**, handwriting, spelling, basic grammar and punctuation, and short writing pieces.

**Key Stage 2 (Years 3–6):** Fluent reading and **comprehension** (inference, summary, vocabulary), structured **writing** (plan–draft–edit), advanced grammar and punctuation, and spelling rules/patterns.

## Common sticky spots

* Blending/segmenting in **phonics** and “tricky words.”
* **Inference** in reading—reading between the lines.
* **Sentence structure**, tenses, and punctuation (commas, apostrophes).
* **Spelling** patterns and homophones.
* **Handwriting stamina** and presentation.

## How I support your child

* Personalised reading and writing plan, matched to current stage.
* Clear routines: modelled writing, guided practice, and feedback.
* Phonics refreshers where helpful; explicit **vocabulary** teaching.
* “Read → think → talk → write” cycles to build confidence.
* Light-touch tasks at home and regular updates for you.
