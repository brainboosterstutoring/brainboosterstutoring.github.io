## What’s covered (at a glance)

KS3 builds creative confidence and technical skill. Pupils learn to:
- **Develop ideas and creativity**, becoming more **proficient with materials and techniques** (drawing, painting, sculpture and more). ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Record observations** in sketchbooks/journals as a basis for exploring ideas. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Analyse and evaluate** their own and others’ work to strengthen visual impact. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Know about artists, craft makers, designers and architecture**, including major periods and movements from ancient to modern. ([GOV.UK][1])

## Common sticky spots

- **Perfectionism vs. experimentation:** fear of “getting it wrong” can block creative risk-taking.  
- **Observation & proportion:** translating what they see onto the page (scale, alignment, perspective).  
- **Composition & colour decisions:** planning a balanced piece and mixing colours purposefully.  
- **Art vocabulary & critique:** describing choices and giving evidence-based feedback with confidence.  
- **Sustained projects:** turning sketchbook exploration into a finished, coherent piece.

## How I support your child

- **Calm, low-pressure studio feel:** process over perfection—small wins every lesson.  
- **Step-by-step teaching:** I model techniques (line, tone, proportion, composition), then guide practice before independent work.  
- **Sketchbook routines:** regular observational drawing, thumbnails, and annotations to develop ideas that lead to stronger outcomes.  
- **Wider knowledge, stronger voice:** short, engaging look-ins to artists, designers and architects to inspire style choices and cultural context. ([GOV.UK][1])  
- **Clear feedback for growth:** kind, specific critiques and simple targets; brief parent updates and optional home tasks to lock in progress.
