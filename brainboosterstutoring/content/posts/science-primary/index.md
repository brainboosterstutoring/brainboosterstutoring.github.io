## What’s covered (at a glance)

**Key Stage 1:** Plants; animals (including humans); everyday materials; **seasonal changes**.

**Lower KS2 (Y3–4):** Rocks, plants, animals (incl. nutrition), **states of matter**, **sound**, **electricity**.

**Upper KS2 (Y5–6):** Living things & habitats, **circulatory system**, properties & changes of materials, **Earth & space**, **forces**.
Across all years: **Working scientifically**—observing, classifying, fair testing, measuring, using results, and presenting data.

## Common sticky spots

* Abstract ideas (particles, gravity, circuits).
* Setting up a **fair test** and controlling variables.
* Choosing and drawing the **right graph**; reading scales.
* Explaining conclusions with **evidence** and correct vocabulary.

## How I support your child

* Hands-on investigations with clear safety and structure.
* Diagrams, models, and simple experiments to make ideas concrete.
* Pre-teaching scientific **vocabulary** and sentence stems for explanations.
* Mini “maths-in-science” boosts for measures, tables, and graphs.
* Curiosity-first approach—questions are welcomed and valued.
