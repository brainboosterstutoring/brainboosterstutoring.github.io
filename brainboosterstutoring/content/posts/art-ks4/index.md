## What’s covered (at a glance)

At **Key Stage 4 (Years 10–11)**, maintained schools must offer access to courses in **the arts** (including Art & Design) that lead to an **approved qualification**. Programmes typically build on KS3 aims—**producing creative work**, becoming **proficient with techniques**, **evaluating** work using art vocabulary, and **knowing about artists, craft makers and designers**—and extend them into sustained projects and a coherent personal portfolio. ([GOV.UK][1])

Typical study strands include:

- **Developing ideas** from personal themes and contextual research.  
- **Exploring media and processes**: drawing, painting, printmaking, sculpture, textiles, photography and digital.  
- **Recording and annotating**: observational studies, photography, notes and reflections that track decisions.  
- **Presenting a personal, resolved outcome** that communicates intent.

> Source context: KS4 entitlement to the arts and the subject aims for Art & Design in the national curriculum framework. ([GOV.UK][1])

## Common sticky spots

- **Sustained portfolio work**: turning early experiments into a clear, personal direction.  
- **Contextual links**: moving beyond biography to analyse how specific artists’ **materials, techniques and ideas** inform their own work.  
- **Experimentation → refinement**: purposeful testing, then improving craft and composition.  
- **Annotation quality**: concise, reflective writing that explains intent, decisions and next steps.  
- **Time management**: balancing sketchbook development with making final outcomes.  
- **Presenting a coherent final piece** that aligns with the journey shown in the portfolio.

## How I support your child

- **Diagnostic → tailored plan:** I identify strengths/gaps, then map a realistic timeline and checkpoints.  
- **Technique workshops:** focused sessions in drawing, painting, printmaking, 3D, textiles or digital—matched to project needs.  
- **Sketchbook routines that work:** mini-briefs for studies, purposeful annotation prompts, and quick composition thumbnails.  
- **Context first:** short, engaging look-ins to artists/designers/architects to spark ideas and deepen analysis.  
- **Iterative feedback:** kind, specific critiques with actionable targets; small wins every lesson to build momentum.  
- **Parent updates:** brief notes and optional home tasks to keep the portfolio moving between sessions.
