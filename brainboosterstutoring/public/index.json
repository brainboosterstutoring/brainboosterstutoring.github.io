If you\u0026rsquo;re thinking about becoming a teacher and wondering how to get Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) in the UK, here’s what I learned from going through the process myself.\n🛤️ Which Route I Took # As a career changer, I didn’t want to go back to uni for another three years — I was only three years out of university! I decided I needed something focused and practical. I chose the Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) with QTS, a 1-year full-time course that combines academic learning with real classroom teaching.\nThere are other routes, too:\nAssessment Only (AO) — great if you’ve already been working in schools for a couple of years without formal training. SCITT (School-Centred Initial Teacher Training) — very hands-on and school-based, often with QTS included. iQTS or direct QTS application — if you’re coming from abroad. ⏳ Duration # Most PGCE with QTS courses take 1 academic year full-time, or up to 2 years part-time. The Assessment Only route is much quicker — usually wrapped up within 12 weeks — but it\u0026rsquo;s only an option if you’ve got at least two years of solid teaching experience.\n💷 Costs (and Funding Options) # Here\u0026rsquo;s what I paid (and how I managed):\nTuition: Around £9,250 for the PGCE. Living costs: I applied for a student maintenance loan and qualified for a bursary (which varies depending on the subject — maths, physics, and computing often have the highest ones). Many people also get help from career change support programs, like Now Teach or Transition to Teach. If you’re doing Assessment Only, costs are lower — typically £2,000–£4,000, but there’s usually no funding available for that route.\n📍 Where to Study # There are lots of providers, so it’s worth doing your homework. A few standouts:\nUniversities: UCL (where I studied for my QTS), University of Manchester, University of East Anglia (where I studied for my degree!) SCITT programmes: Based in schools, very practical Tes Institute, University of Buckingham, or Sunderland: Some offer flexible or online options Look for something that suits your style — whether you’re more academically minded or learn best by doing.\n🎓 Why QTS Was Worth It # Getting QTS gave me the professional recognition I needed to teach in state schools. But more than that, it gave me confidence, structure, and a deeper understanding of teaching.\n","date":"1 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/how_to_qts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Changing Careers?

As time went on however, I realised that while subject knowledge is important, the ability to teach effectively requires deeper training. This is especially across a range of needs and learning styles. That’s what led me to pursue Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). I wanted to build on my experience with a professional accreditation that would strengthen my teaching practice, give me a solid grounding in pedagogy and safeguarding, and ultimately help me support my students even better.\nTo gain QTS, I completed rigorous teacher training, learned how to adapt to different learning needs, passed multiple classroom assessments, and trained in safeguarding and child development. It’s not just about knowing the subject—it’s about knowing how to teach it effectively, safely, and in a way that supports long-term progress.\nHow That Helps Your Child as a Tutor # I Know the Curriculum—Inside and Out # Because of my QTS training and experience, I’m confident navigating the national curriculum at every level—from phonics and SATs to GCSEs and A-Levels. I won’t just help your child “get through their work”—I’ll help them truly understand what they’re learning, and why it matters.\nI Teach, Not Just Explain # Being a tutor with QTS means I bring full teaching strategies into our sessions. I don’t just go through answers—I build your child’s confidence, develop their independent thinking, and help them overcome the “I’m just not good at this” mindset.\nI’m Trained to Support Additional Needs # If your child has dyslexia, ADHD, autism, or struggles with anxiety, you’ll want someone who understands how to adapt their approach. With QTS, I’ve had formal training in special educational needs (SEND), behaviour management, and building a safe and supportive learning environment.\nYou Can Trust the Standards I Work To # My QTS status means:\nI’ve passed enhanced DBS checks I follow safeguarding guidelines I work to national teaching standards You don’t have to wonder if I’m qualified—I’m held to the same professional bar as every classroom teacher.\nI Focus on Long-Term Growth, Not Quick Fixes # Lots of tutors can help a student cram for a test. I do that too—but I also focus on helping your child become a more confident, capable learner who can approach future challenges with resilience.\nIn Summary # Hiring a tutor with QTS means your child gets the benefit of qualified teaching expertise, but in a 1-to-1 setting tailored to their needs. Whether your child is falling behind, struggling with confidence, or aiming to excel, my goal is to support them with care, structure, and professional insight.\nIf you’d like to chat about how I can help your child thrive—whether it’s in maths, English, or general study support—feel free to get in touch. I’d be happy to discuss your child’s needs and how I can support them.\nWarm regards,\nRhian Poole\nQTS-Certified Private Tutor\n","date":"1 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/qts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Why My QTS Boosts Your Child’s Tutoring Success","type":"posts"},{"content":" Hi, I’m Rhian — a qualified teacher and experienced private tutor with a calm, patient, and structured approach to learning. I hold a degree in English and American Literature from the University of East Anglia (2:1, 2013) and a Primary PGCE from UCL.\nOver the past twelve years, I’ve supported children from age 3 to 16 through one-to-one tuition, small group sessions, and classroom work. My background includes working as a teaching assistant and classroom teacher in both mainstream and SEND schools, where I developed a strong understanding of how to adapt lessons to different learning styles, needs, and personalities.\nI specialise in creating nurturing, inclusive learning environments where every student feels seen, heard, and capable—particularly those with additional needs such as ADHD, autism, and dyslexia. With four years’ experience supporting SEND learners, I know how to tailor lessons to build confidence, close learning gaps, and foster curiosity and self-belief.\nI tutor across the primary and secondary curriculum, covering phonics, SATs, entrance exams, GCSE revision, and essential skills in literacy, numeracy, reading, grammar, and more. Whether your child is catching up, preparing for exams, or simply needs a boost in confidence, I provide engaging, supportive lessons that meet them where they are.\nEducation is about more than just academic results. It’s about building resilience, independence, and a love of learning. That’s why I work closely with parents, schools, and professionals to create a joined-up, collaborative approach that supports each child holistically.\nLessons are available online or in-person (based in W5, West London), and I hold an enhanced DBS certificate.\nIf you’re looking for a tutor who leads with empathy, clarity, and a commitment to helping every child thrive—I’d love to hear from you.\n","date":"29 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Welcome to Rhians Tutoring Website! 🎉","summary":"","title":"About Me","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"29 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/rhianpooleproshot/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Rhianpooleproshot","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"29 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/sample/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Sample","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/testimonials/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Testimonials","type":"tags"},{"content":" \u0026hellip;Rhian has an incredible ability to connect with young learners, making lessons engaging and enjoyable\u0026hellip; highly recommend Rhian to anyone looking for a skilled and supportive tutor!1\n\u0026hellip;Rhian is patient with kids and very thorough in all aspects of her tuition.
